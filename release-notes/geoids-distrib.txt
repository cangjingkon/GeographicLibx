These files give the geoid heights on a rectangular grid.  It's
necessary to download and install at least one of these files if you
want to use the Geoid class in GeographicLib.

Download either the tar.bz2 file or zip file (they have the same
contents).  If you're unsure which one to install, start with

    egm96-5
