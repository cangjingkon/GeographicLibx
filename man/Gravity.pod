=head1 NAME

Gravity -- compute the earth's gravity field

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<Gravity> [ B<-n> I<name> ] [ B<-d> I<dir> ]
[ B<-G> | B<-H> | B<-A> ] [ B<-c> I<lat> I<h> ]
[ B<-p> I<prec> ]
[ B<-v> ] [ B<--version> | B<-h> | B<--help> ]
[ B<--input-file> I<infile> | B<--input-string> I<instring> ]
[ B<--output-file> I<outfile> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Gravity> reads and positions on standard input and prints out the
gravity field on standard output.

The input line is of the form I<lat> I<lon> I<h>.  I<lat> and I<lon> are
the latitude and longitude expressed as decimal degrees or degrees,
minutes, and seconds; see GeoConvert(1) for details.  I<h> is the height
above the ellipsoid in meters; this quantity is optional and defaults to
0.  Alternatively, the gravity field can be computed at various points
on a circle of latitude via the B<-c> option; in this case only the
longitude should be given on the input lines.

=over

=item B<-G>

computes gravity and the gravity disturbance.  The output consists of 5
items I<gx> I<gy> I<gz> I<deltay> I<deltaz> (all in m/s^2).  (Note that
I<deltax> = I<gx>.)

=item B<-H>

return the geoid height (meters).  In this case the I<h> should be zero.

=item B<-A>

computes the gravitational anomaly.  The output consists of 3 items
I<Dg01> I<xi> I<eta>, where I<Dg01> is in mGal (1 mGal = 10^-5 m/s^2)
and I<xi> and I<eta> are in arcseconds.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-n>

use gravity field model I<name> instead of the default C<egm96>.  See
L<MODELS|models>.

=item B<-d>

read gravity models from I<dir> instead of the default.  See
L<MODELS|models>.

=item B<-G>

compute the acceleration due to gravity.

=item B<-H>

compute the height of the geoid abover the reference ellipsoid.

=item B<-A>

compute the gravity anomaly.

=item B<-c>

evaluate the field on a circle of latitude at I<lat>, I<h> instead of
reading these quantities from the input lines.  In this case, B<Gravity>
can calculate the field considerably quicker.  If geoid heights are
being computed (the B<-H> option), then I<h> must be zero.

=item B<-p>

set the precision to I<prec> (default 5).

=item B<-v>

print information about the gravity model on standard error before
processing the input.

=item B<--version>

print version and exit.

=item B<-h>

print usage, the default gravity path and name, and exit.

=item B<--help>

print full documentation and exit.

=item B<--input-file>

read input from the file I<infile> instead of from standard input; a file
name of "-" stands for standard input.

=item B<--input-string>

read input from the string I<instring> instead of from standard input.
All the semicolons in I<instring> are converted to newlines before the
reading begins.

=item B<--output-file>

write output to the file I<outfile> instead of to standard output; a
file name of "-" stands for standard output.

=back

=head1 MODELS

B<Gravity> computes the gravity field using one of the
following models

    egm84, earth gravity model 1984.  See
      http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/wgs84_180/wgs84_180.html
    egm96, earth gravity model 1996.  See
      http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html
    egm2008, earth gravity model 2008.  See
      http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008
    wgs2008, world geodetic system 1984.  For returns the gravity for
      the WGS84 ellipsoid.

By default, the C<egm96> gravity model is used.  This may changed by
setting the environment variable C<GRAVITY_NAME> or with the B<-n>
option.

The gravity models will be loaded from a directory specified at compile
time.  This may changed by setting the environment variables
C<GRAVITY_PATH> or C<GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA>, or with the B<-d> option.
The B<-h> option prints the default gravity path and name.  Use the
B<-v> option to ascertain the full path name of the data file.

Instructions for downloading and installing gravity models are
available at
L<http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/gravity.html#gravityinst>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item B<GRAVITY_NAME>

Override the compile-time default gravity name of C<wmm2010>.  The B<-h>
option reports the value of B<GRAVITY_NAME>, if defined, otherwise it
reports the compile-time value.  If the B<-n> I<name> option is used,
then I<name> takes precedence.

=item B<GRAVITY_PATH>

Override the compile-time default gravity path.  This is typically
C</usr/local/share/GeographicLib/gravity> on Unix-like systems and
C<C:/Documents and Settings/All Users/Application
Data/GeographicLib/gravity> on Windows systems.  The B<-h> option reports
the value of B<GRAVITY_PATH>, if defined, otherwise it reports the
compile-time value.  If the B<-d> I<dir> option is used, then I<dir>
takes precedence.

=item B<GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA>

Another way of overriding the compile-time default gravity path.  If it
is set (and if B<GRAVITY_PATH> is not set), then
$B<GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA>/gravity is used.

=back

=head1 ERRORS

An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output
beginning with C<ERROR:> and causes B<Gravity> to return an exit
code of 1.  However, an error does not cause B<Gravity> to
terminate; following lines will be converted.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The gravity field from EGM96 in Timbuktu on 2012-01-01

    echo "16d46'33N" "3d00'34W" 300 | Gravity -p 9
    => -0.000018463 -0.000008217 -9.783931398
                    -0.000006866 -0.000229489

The first two numbers returned are the declination and inclination of
the field.  The second line gives the annual change.
