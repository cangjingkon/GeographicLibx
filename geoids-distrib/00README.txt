These files give the geoid heights on a rectangular grid.  It's
necessary to download and install at least one of these files if you
want to use the Geoid class in GeographicLib.

The data is provided either as a compressed tar (extension .tar.bz2), a
zip file, or a windows installer (extension .exe).  If you're unsure
which one to install, start with

 egm96-5
