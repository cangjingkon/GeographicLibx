This package includes two routines GEDISTANCE and GERECKON which solve
the inverse and direct problems for great ellipses on the surface of an
ellipsoid of revolution.  Optionally the area between the great ellipse
and the equator is returned.

The problem and method of solution is described in

This package depends on the MATLAB File Exchange package "Geodesics on
an ellipsoid of revolution" for performing meridian arc computations:
