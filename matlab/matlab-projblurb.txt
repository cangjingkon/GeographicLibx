This package includes two geodesic projections

  * the azimuthal equidistant projection
  * the gnomonic projection

These generalize the projections of the MATLAB mapping toolbox to
include an ellipsoidal model of the earth.  The functions provided are
EQDAZIMFWD, EQDAZIMREV, GNOMONICFWD, and GNOMONICREV.

The ellipsoidal gnomonic projection is an azimuthal projection about a
center point.  All geodesics through the center point are projected into
straight lines with the correct azimuth relative to the center point.
In addition all geodesics are pass close to the center point are very
nearly straight.  The projection is derived in Section 8 of

The primary importance of these projections is that they offer a
convenient way of solving various geometrical problems on the ellipsoid.
In particular the azimuthal equidistant projection allows problems
associated with determining maritime boundaries to be solved easily.
Similary the gnomonic projection allows the intersection of two
geodesics to be determined quickly.  

This package depends on the MATLAB File Exchange package "Geodesics on
an ellipsoid of revolution" for performing the necessary geodesic
computations:
