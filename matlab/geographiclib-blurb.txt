GeographicLib toolbox
Version 1.42 2015-04-24

This toolbox provides native MATLAB implementations of a subset of the
C++ library, GeographicLib.  Key components of this toolbox are

  * Geodesics: direct, inverse, area calculations.
  * Projections: transverse Mercator, polar stereographic, etc.
  * Grid systems: UTM, UPS, MGRS.
  * Geoid lookup: EGM84, EGM96, EGM2008 geoids supported.
  * Geometric transformations: geocentric, local cartesian.
  * Great ellipses: direct, inverse, area calculations.

There is some overlap between this toolbox and MATLAB's Mapping
Toolbox.  However, this toolbox offers:
  * better accuracy;
  * treatment of oblate and prolate ellipsoids;
  * guaranteed convergence for geoddistance;
  * calculation of area and differential properties of geodesics;
  * ellipsoidal versions of the equidistant azimuthal and gnomonic
    projections.

This package incorporates the following packages:

  Geodesics on an ellipsoid of revolution

  Geodesic projections for an ellipsoid

  Great ellipses

Including all of the functionality in a single toolbox allows easier
sharing of code (i.e., via a common private directory).

Extensive documentation on the C++ library is available at
