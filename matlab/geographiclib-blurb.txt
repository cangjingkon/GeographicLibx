This toolbox provides native MATLAB implementations of a subset of the
C++ library, GeographicLib.  Key components of this toolbox are

  * Geodesics: direct, inverse, area calculations.
  * Projections: transverse Mercator, polar stereographic, etc.
  * Grid systems: UTM, UPS, MGRS.
  * Geoid lookup: EGM84, EGM96, EGM2008 geoids supported.
  * Geometric transformations: geocentric, local cartesian.
  * Great ellipses: direct, inverse, area calculations.

There is some overlap between this toolbox and MATLAB's Mapping
Toolbox.  However, this toolbox offers:

  * better accuracy;
  * treatment of oblate and prolate ellipsoids;
  * guaranteed convergence for geoddistance;
  * calculation of area and differential properties of geodesics;
  * ellipsoidal versions of the equidistant azimuthal and gnomonic
    projections.

Subsets of this package were previously released as:

  Geodesics on an ellipsoid of revolution

  Geodesic projections for an ellipsoid

Including all of the functionality in a single toolbox allows easier
sharing of code (via a common private directory).

Extensive documentation on the C++ library is available at

Geoid lookup requires the installation of one or more geoid models.
Instructions for this are given in

A problem with the way MATLAB Central packages toolboxes causes the
"Robust Control Toolbox" to be listed as a required product. This is
wrong; this package has no dependencies other than MATLAB (version 7.9
or later) or Octave (version 3.4 or later).
