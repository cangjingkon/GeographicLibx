Installation instructions for GeographicLib

(1) On Linux and systems with GNU C++

    make
    make install
    make install-doc

This installs into /usr/local.  To install elsewhere, use, e.g.,

    make PREFIX=/opt/local install install-doc

Documentation is also available at

    http://geographiclib.sf.net/html

(2) On most Unix systems with autoconf

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you want the library to be installed in a different location, start
with

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/local

This procedure overwrites the Makefile used in (1).  To revert to
non-autoconf method, do

    echo include Makefile.mk > Makefile

(3) On Windows with Visual Studio

Load the solution file windows/GeographicLib-vc9.sln (or -vc10 or -vc8)
into Visual Studio 2008 (or 2010 or 2005) and build the solution.  The
library and utilities will be in, e.g., windows/Release.
