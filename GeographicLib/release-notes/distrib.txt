These files contain the source code for GeogragphicLib.  The version
numbering is by year and month, i.e., Geographic-YYYY-MM.tgz.  Usually
you will only need to download the latest version.

The files are packaged as either a compressed tar file (tgz) or a zip
file.  (The two archives have identical contents; however, the text
files in the zip archive have Windows-style line endings.)

The library is documented at

  http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/index.html

For information on the changes between versions, see

  http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/old.html

If you want to use the GeographicLib::Geoid class, you will also need to
download one of the geoid models from
