These files contain the source code for GeogragphicLib.

The original version numbering scheme is by year and month, e.g.,
Geographic-2009-11.tgz.

Currently the library uses libtool's version numbering scheme (interface
and revision), e.g., geographiclib-2.1.tar.gz.

Usually you will only need to download the latest version.

The files are packaged as either a compressed tar file (tar.gz or tgz)
or a zip file.  (The two archives have identical contents.)

The library is documented at

  http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/index.html

For information on the changes between versions, see

  http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/old.html

If you want to use the GeographicLib::Geoid class, you will also need to
download one of the geoid models from

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/geographiclib/files/geoids-distrib
