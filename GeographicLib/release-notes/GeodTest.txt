TMCoords.dat.gz contains 287000 points giving the transformation between
geographic coordinates and the transverse Mercator projection. The WGS84
ellipsoid is used, with central meridian 0 deg, central scale factor
0.9996 (the UTM value), false easting = false northing = 0 m.  Each line
of the file contains:

  * latitude (degrees, exact)
  * longitude (degrees, exact)
  * easting (meters, accurate to 0.1 pm)
  * northing (meters, accurate to 0.1 pm)
  * meridian convergence (degrees, accurate to 10^-18 deg)
  * scale (accurate to 10^-20)
