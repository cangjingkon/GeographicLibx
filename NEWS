  * cmake tweaks:
    + improve find_package's matching of compiler versions;
    + CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set from CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH if available;

    GEOGRAPHICLIB_GEOID_PATH, etc.); similarly, GeoidEval, Gravity, and
    MagneticField, look at the environment variable GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA
    to locate the data.

  * Slight improvement in starting guess for solution of geographic
    latitude in terms of conformal latitude in TransverseMercator,
    TransverseMercatorExact, and LambertConformalConic.

  * For most classes, get rid of const member variables so that the
    default copy assignment works.

  * Put Math and Accumulator in their own header files.

  * Remove unused "fast" GeographicLib::Accumulator method.

  * Reorganize the Python interface.

  * Withdraw some deprecated routines.

  * cmake changes:

    + trim precision of area to 3 decimal places;
    + FIX BUG with pole crossing edges (due to compiler optimization).

    and the geodesic area.

  * FIX BUGS (compiler-specific) in inverse geodesic calculations.

  * FIX BUG: accommodate tellg() returning -1 at end of string.

  * Change way flattening of the ellipsoid is specified:
    + constructors take f argument which is taken to be the flattening
      if f < 1 and the inverse flattening otherwise (this is a
      compatible change for spheres and oblate ellipsoids, but it is an
      INCOMPATIBLE change for prolate ellipsoids);
    + the -e arguments to the Utility Programs are handled similarly; in
      addition, simple fractions, e.g., 1/297, can be used for the
      flattening;
    + introduce Constants::WGS84_f() for the WGS84 flattening (and
      deprecate Constants::WGS84_r() for the inverse flattening);
    + most classes have a Flattening() member function;

      geoid;
    + Add --msltohae and --haetomsl as GeoidEval options (and don't
      document the single hyphen versions).

  * Remove documentation that duplicates papers on transverse Mercator
    and geodesics.

Changes between 1.7 (released 2010-12-21) and 1.6 versions:
